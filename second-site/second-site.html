  <h2>LIMINAL SPACE</h2>
  <h3>WHAT IS LIMINAL SPACE?</h3>
  <p>A liminal space is often a transitional space; a place you pass through on your way to another place; the in-between. Of course these spaces are not always transitional, and more often than not they are empty. Empty as in a lack of activity where activity is normally present. For example, the hallways of a school after hours; it's empty and strange, almost like you should not be there. You are used to experiencing, loud crowded hallways, but now you are seeing the space in a different context. These spaces evoke feelings of unease.</p>
  <p>Key characteristics that make a space liminal:</p>
    <li>places at night</li>
    <li>poor lighting</li>
    <li>empty places</li>
    <li>abandoned places</li>
    <li>places after normal operating hours</li>
    <li>places that are outdated</li>
    <li>the space between two destinations</li>
    <li>feeling like you've been there before or strangely familiar</li>
  <p>In the right context, many spaces can become a liminal space.</p>
