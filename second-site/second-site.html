  <h1>Liminal Space</h1>
  <p>Often a space of transition.</p>
  <p>A place you end up on your way to another place.</p>
  <p>The in-between.</p>
<img src="img/liminal.jpg">
<p>A feeling of unease as if you are somewhere that you are not supposed to be.</p>
<p>These spaces tend to be empty in the sense that they lack activity where there is supposed to be activity. Examples of this emptiness include:</p>
<ol>Hallways</ol>
<ol>Outdated spaces</ol>
<ol>Poorly lit spaces</ol>
<ol>Spaces at night</ol>
<ol>Abandon spaces</ol>
