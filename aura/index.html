    <div class="words">
      <p>The feeling of being outside on a cold fall night.</p>
      <p>You start to smell the faint scent of smoke coming from your left.</p>
      <p>You follow it.</p>
      <p>The smoke gets stronger as you make your way through the woods in complete darkness.</p>
      <p>The only sounds you can hear are the leaves crunching beneath your shoes and the sound of tree branches as you push them out of the way making a path for yourself.</p>
      <p>Eventually your surroundings start to illuminate more and more as you inch closer to the fire.</p>
      <p>As you emerge out of the woods, you are engulfed with orange and red light and the sounds of crackling wood.</p>
      <p>You step closer.</p>
      <p>The heat is a warm hug.</p>
      <p>You sit down onto the cold grass and slowly become entranced in the fire.</p>
      <p>You never notice that you are in the middle of a field somewhere with no one in sight.</p>
      <p>The woods that you went through have disappeared and there is only emptiness for miles, but you never notice.</p>
      <p>The fire seems to stay lit forever.</p>
